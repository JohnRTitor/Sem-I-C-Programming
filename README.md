## Introduction

In this repository, you will find a collection of C programming assignments that I completed during my BSc Computer Science college course. These assignments cover various topics such as arrays, strings, file I/O, and more. Each program is self-contained and can be compiled and executed independently.

Please note that this repository is read-only, and I do not accept pull requests or issues for it. However, you are welcome to explore the code, learn from it, and use it as a reference for your own projects.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into several folders, each representing a different category of C programming assignments. Here's an overview of the folder structure:

- **Array**: Contains C programs related to arrays.
- **String**: Contains C programs related to strings.
- **File IO**: Contains C programs related to file input/output operations.
- and more.... 

Feel free to navigate through the folders and explore the code. Each folder contains individual .c files representing separate programming assignments. You can open these files to view the source code and understand the logic behind each program.
